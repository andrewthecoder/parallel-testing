Parallel Technology Comparison Platform
========================

### Task:
Develop and measure parallel versions of a program which calculates Euler's totient using the following high-level parallel programming technologies:

* Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) 
* Message Passing Interface (MPI)
* Glasgow parallel Haskell (GpH)
* Single Assignment C (SaC)

Compare the performance and programming models of these technologies.

### Solution:
Web-based testing and graphing platform, built upon Symfony 2 with a MySQL database.
Pretty graphs made with help from the Highcharts JS library
